## Project Details

This project was done as part of deep reinforcement learning nanodegree by Udacity. In this environment, two agents control rackets to bounce a ball over a net. If an agent hits the ball over the net, it receives a reward of +0.1. If an agent lets a ball hit the ground or hits the ball out of bounds, it receives a reward of -0.01. Thus, the goal of each agent is to keep the ball in play.

## Getting Started


Install anaconda(python package manager)-python 3, then run ./install.sh file.This will install unity ml-agents, torch and other neccessery libraries

## Instructions

Run **Tennis.ipynb**. Agents uses DDPG algorithm to learn how to play tennis according to the environment.The task is episodic, and in order to solve the environment, the agents must get an average score of +0.5 (over 100 consecutive episodes).
